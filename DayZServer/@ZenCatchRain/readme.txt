What Is This?

This is a mod based on the old CatchRain mod by PoPo. PoPo kindly allowed editing & reuploading of their mod, and while I liked the original CatchRain mod, I wanted to add some changes for my server.

This version of the mod allows players to catch rain in water containers when it's raining heavily.

Players can also put their water containers on the ground and select an action to collect rain - this method is much slower, but allows you to perform other tasks while the rain accumulates.

The player can catch rain while moving - but they must look up towards the sky to get the action option, and the faster you move, the slower you catch rain. Standing still is the fastest method, and pots capture rain much faster than canteens or bottles. You cannot catch rain while under a roof or large trees.

The rain accumulates very slowly, so players will still have an incentive to seek out wells, ponds and rivers, but if they're desperate and it's raining they now have the option to catch rain (if they're patient).

After running it for a few weeks it seems it's working fine so I figured I'd release it publicly.

Notes:

The player must look up at the sky (45 degree pitch to be exact) to get the action prompt. The weather must also be VERY wet and overcast, a sunshower will not suffice.

I included a stringtable so translations should work for all languages (although some translations might be inaccurate as I used an automatic translation tool).

Please report any bugs and I'll fix them ASAP - or feel free to fix them yourself and repack, it's open source (more info below).

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. It must be run on both server and client. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys.

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind my future updates won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.io

Enjoy!
